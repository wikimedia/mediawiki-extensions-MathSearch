The study evaluates the quality of mathematical formulae in MediaWiki, the software that runs Wikipedia, with regard to three aspects:\n\n# LaTeX input: Is the formula source code typed correctly? (Using <syntaxhighlight lang=\"latex\" inline>\\sin</syntaxhighlight> instead of <syntaxhighlight lang=\"latex\" inline>sin</syntaxhighlight>)\n# Rendering: Is the formula displayed correctly? (Even correct LaTeX input might lead to unreadable formulae on certain devices.)\n# Semantics: Is the MediaWiki Math extension capable of capturing the formulae semantics correctly? (<math>f(a+b)</math> might stand for the \"function <math>f</math> applied the sum of <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>\" or \"variable <math>f</math> times the sum of <math>a</math> plus <math>b</math>\")\n\nIn the following, you will be guided through a five step evaluation process. Detailled information are provided in the infobox on the right. Note that questsions, with only one possible answer, always have the first possible option pre-selected.",
